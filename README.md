  <#summit-conquest>Summit-Conquest

Summit Conquest (Unity CwCL Prototype 4) Version 1.0

Unity Course: Create with Code Live

Week 5: Gameplay Mechanics | Apr 20 - 24 (2020)


    <#1-overview>1) Overview:

Based on the course prototype, I made a full game adding a lot of
features built from the ground, learning A LOT in the process.

(from Course description): This week, you will program an arcade-style
Sumo battle with the objective of knocking increasingly difficult waves
of enemies off of a floating island, using power ups to help defeat
them. In creating this prototype, you will learn how to implement new
gameplay mechanics into your projects, which are new rules or systems
that make the game more interesting to play. On one hand, you will learn
to program a powerup, which give the player a temporary advantage. On
the other hand, you will learn to program increasingly difficult enemy
waves, which make survival more challenging for the player. A good
balance of powerups and increasing difficulty make for a much more
interesting gameplay experience.


    <#2-game-instructions>2) Game Instructions:

Survive continually increasing enemies for 2 minutes. You have 3 lives
to get the highest score.

|    Pick up Powerup X (multiply): Super Push for 10 seconds.
    Pick up Powerup Flame: Charged Bomb. No time limit, detonate with space while jumping.
    +1 life with each 20000 points mark.

    Move Forward:           (keyboard) W or keyUp                   / (mouse) LeftClick
    Move Backward:          (keyboard) S or keyDown
    Turn Camera:            (keyboard) A+D or keyLeft+keyRight      / (mouse) LeftRight Axis
    Jump:                   (keyboard) Space                        / (mouse) RightClick
    Keyboard On/Off:        (keyboard) F1
    Mouse On/Off:           (keyboard) F2
|


      <#score>Score:

|    Small Enemy             100
    Big Enemy              2000
    Cannon Ball              50
    Super Push collect      200
    Charged Bomb collect    300
    Level win              5000 (+ 10 points x seconds)
|


      <#statistics>Statistics:

|    Player: HIST: hiscore / total score added / levels passed / seconds survived / lives lost
    Enemy beaten (big, small, cannonball): Current game / total
    Powerup collected: idem
|


    <#3-project-work-features-modifications-settings>3) Project work
    (features, modifications, settings):

  * Project Settings: Graphics High (Tier 3) unchecked Cascade Shadows
    (recurring issue detected with objects' visible border).
  * Environment: Lighting changed. FX_Mist particle system color and
    other modifications.
  * UI: Added keyboard+mouse icons, input devices can be both set
    active/inactive through keys F1 and F2.
  * UI: Complete information added: level, time, score + high score,
    lives. Save data locally.
  * Statistics: collect and read/write from local system. Shows info in
    menu.
  * Game Manager: built a "Control" idea before learning about a "Game
    Manager" :)
  * Player: respawn when fall down, lives control + extra lives
  * Game: time survive gameplay
  * Enemy: Added enemy spawn frequency. Added different enemies (Small:
    fast, weak, pushable, heavy spawn / Big: slow, strong, few spawn,
    fire Cannon Balls).
  * Enemy: Design, Textures and Animations finished.
  * Powerups: Two powerups
  * Game: physics tuning for different masses and forces applied.
    Completed for player, enemies, powerups actions including explosions.
  * Sound: Background music and Sound effects for almost every player
    and enemy actions.
  * Menu: full options control with graphic design, shows full
    statistics, save data locally. Restart/Exit.
  * Confirmation Dialog: hard work that can be improved, but a useful
    tool for all projects
  * Title screen with Game Instructions.
  * Documentation, version control, public release.


    <#4-to-do>4) To Do:

  * Code: Use Object Pooler for instantiate prefabs.
  * Game: Difficulty progression (more time to survive, less powerups?,
    IA?).
  * IA: Bigger enemies try to avoid falling down.
  * Sound: some missing sounds (player/enemy entry, player fall, high
    score, victory, game over)
  * Powerups: timer float counter.
  * Instructions + Statistics: add icons and better design
  * Control: tweak for gamepad control (assign rotate view to right stick)
  * Control: Add mouse/camera sensibility setting
  * Fix: .Enemy: too much aceleration sometimes. .Audio slider not
    always plays sample sound right.
  * Known Issues: .Physical forces in screen sometimes produces weird
    movements. .Enemies spotlights strange effect (covering a large
    area) at some angles .Statistics panel slow mouse wheel scroll
    .Code: some twisted code, product of learning on the go (mainly with
    parallel "Update" routines)
